This app was based on a sample from [Ahmed Alparslan Ã–zdemir](https://github.com/alparslanahmed/MekanBul).  Thank you.

Uses the [Angular Leaflet Directive](https://tombatossals.github.io/angular-leaflet-directive/) by [David Rubert](https://github.com/tombatossals).

Of course, it wouldn't exist without the fine folks from [Drifty](http://www.drifty.com) and the [Ionic Framework Team](http://ionicframework.com).
